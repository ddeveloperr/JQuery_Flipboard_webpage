# JQuery_Flipboard_webpage
Use jQuery to building the Flipboard home page.

I used jQuery to recreate the Flipboard home page. 
I built a dropdown menu and a carousel from scratch!

Carousels are popular components used on many other websites, like Apple,
Amazon, and Airbnb.... Now I understood how they work and how to build your own.
Great job!
Get momentum, Get inpired to building new projects with passion!
Me. ;)
